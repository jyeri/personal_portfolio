# **Personal Portfolio**

Personal portfolio is digital resume and learning platform in fullstack development.

## **Introduction**

This portfolio page is done in React, Typescript and Vite. It is deployed using Vercel.
Separation of concerns is done by dividing each main component into 3 pieces, useComp -> Comp -> compView.

## **Content**

This portfolio page is constructed of 5 relatively basic components:
1. **Navbar** - Basic navication bar, contains links to social media accounts as well as logo of my own pretty face.
2. **Banner** - Banner that has light animations like self rewriting text and image effects. This sections tells bit more about me and my life in general.
3. **Skills** - Beautiful way of showcasing the languages I am currently interested of learning more about, Actual bars are selfmade with SVG.
4. **Projects** - Bit more complex component. Projects are showcase by the language, cover image and small description. While hoverover effect is small preview video of the project, via clicking new modal should open. In the modal is more detailed desciption, larger video and links to corresponding github page/ vercel deplyement.
5. **Contact** - Simple contact form for minimalistic viewers. Uses EmailJS to relay incoming messages to my email inbox.
